Simulate dice game.  Use simulator to try out different strategies for 
winning.  

Rules:
1.  Each turn starts with fifteen (six sidded) die; 3 x red, 5 x green, 3 x yellow, 1 x hero, 1 x heroine and 1 x santa.  Shake the dice in a cup and select three dice at random.
2.  Roll the three selected dice.
3.  Score the role:
    a.  A Brain is one point, set to the side. Special dice can have two brains on one side.
    b.  A Shotgun blast (or in some cases two per side), is also set to the side.  If you accumulate three blasts/hits, you bust and get zero points.
    c.  Foot prints is a runner.  Keep these dice for the next roll if you continiue.
    d.  A helmet is essentially a -1 for shotgun blasts.  It nullifies one blast.
    e.  An energy bar allows this and all future rolls to convert runners to brains.
4.  If you don't have three hits you can either roll again, or stop hear and bank your brain points.  If you do roll again, pickup the runners (foot print dice), and randomly select enough additional die from the cup to equal three total.
